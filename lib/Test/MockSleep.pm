=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Test::MockSleep> overrides perl's C<sleep> call. A call to C<sleep> will not
really sleep.

It also provides a facility to check how many seconds a program would have slept.


It has a few bonuses:

=over

=item *

If L<Time::HiRes> is available, this module will override its C<sleep> method as
well.

=item *

If L<Test::MockTime> is available, and C<Time::MockSleep> is imported with the
C<:with_mocktime> option, then C<Time::MockTime>'s clock will be adjusted to show
the updated time, B<as-if> the program had actually slept, and the clock is advanced.

=back

=head2 DETERMINING TIME FAKE-SLEPT

There are two means to do this. The more convenient is a function called C<slept>
which is exported to your calling code's namespace.

    use Test::MockSleep;
    sleep(5);
    my $slept = slept();
    
C<Test::MockSleep> retains an internal counter which increments each time sleep
is called. This counter is reset when C<slept> is called, which is presumably
what you want anyway.

If for whatever reason, you do not want the internal counter to be reset, you can
access it directly as a package variable: C<$Test::MockSleep::Slept>, and reset
it manually when desired.

=head2 MANGLING SLEEP

Simply do
    
    use Test::MockSleep;
    
This should be done before C<use>ing other modules which might potentially use
L<Time::HiRes>'s sleep (in which case the calling package's C<sleep> will be
aliased to Time::HiRes' sleep, at the time of import).

If you wish to have your clocked advanced as well, and the module
L<Test::MockTime> is installed, you can do

    use Test::MockTime;
    use Test::MockSleep qw(:with_mocktime);
    
=head2 FINALLY GOING TO BED

    Test::MockSleep->restore();
    
Will restore global sleep's behavior (as well as Time::HiRes').
